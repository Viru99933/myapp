My app

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `myapp` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `myapp` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

We also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `myapp`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `myapp`

Clone the `myapp` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Viru99933/myapp.git
cd myapp
```

### Install Dependencies

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically install `node_module` so you can simply do:

```
npm install
```

After that, you should find out that you have a new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project. The simplest way to start this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:6767`][local-app-url].
